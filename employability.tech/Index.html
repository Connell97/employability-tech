                        The first week of your journey is all about getting to know eachother. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We’ll talk about your interests, experience, goals, and everything in between to help find the best way to get you where you want to be. If you don’t know where that is, don’t worry! We can figure it out together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        As well as planning your journey, you’ll have the opportunity to get a better idea of what we do and how we work; to ask any questions and get to know us better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You’ll set goals and determine how to achieve them, you’ll meet new people, make new connections, and perhaps most importantly, you’ll take the first step towards the future you most want.
